# Smart-Automation-and-Mobility
SAM is a new and revolutionary way of thinking about how we get around â€” one that is cleaner, safer, and more efficient. 
This can take on many different forms, including ride-sharing, car-sharing, public transportation, walking, biking, and more.
We have created an online platform that will provide a variety of efficient and green transportation services to all our users.

Our Website/Android/IOS application will provide various transportation services like ridesharing, booking electric buses, metros, cars, and 2-wheelers, including a vehicle renting option and much more. It will be a single place for managing all the related payments and will completely change the future of transportation.
